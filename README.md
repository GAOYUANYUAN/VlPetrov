# Risk Management Tools based on Scaling Laws and Directional-Change Intrinsic Time

This public GitHub repository has been prepared as part of the European Research Initiative <a href="http://bigdatafinance.eu/">BigDataFinance 2015–2019</a>, an H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network “Training for Big Data in Financial Research and Risk Management”. The name of the corresponding project is "RP12: High-Frequency Trading Risk Management Tools Based on Scaling Laws". 

The repository contains a set of risk management and data analysis tools primarily build using the bases and extensions of the theory of financial scaling laws and the directional-change intrinsic time approach. Each folder contains methods and classed written using the class-based and object-oriented computer-programming language Java. All files have self-explanatory names and are equipped by a detailed description of the main functionality as well as the references to the literature where these methods were described.

All included tools have been tested using extensive sets of high-frequency data from the Forex market. Results of the tests are either described in submitted research papers or are under revision at the current moment of time and will by timely uploaded to this repository later. Among the submitted papers: "Instantaneous Volatility Seasonality of Bitcoin in Directional-Change Intrinsic Time" (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243797">at SSRN</a>) and "Agent-Based Model in Directional-Change Intrinsic Time" (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3240456">at SSRN</a>).

<h3>The main folder contains several methods which could be directly used for high-frequency data analysis and some special risk-management indicators:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/VladUZH/VlPetrov/blob/master/src/LiquidityIndicator_Analysis.java">LiquidityIndicator_Analysis.java</a></strong> - computes liquidity of a real historical time series of tiak-by-tick price data. It is a wrapper for the "LiquidityIndicator" class from the "ievent" folder. To run the program on needs to specify the path to the anylised file and setup several parameters described in the body of the program.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/VladUZH/VlPetrov/blob/master/src/InstantaneousVolatilityActivity_Analisys.java">InstantaneousVolatilityActivity_Analisys.java</a></strong> - this class is the extention of the "ievents/VolatilitySeasonality" class modifies to be applicable to the set of historical or real-time high-frequency price data.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/VladUZH/VlPetrov/blob/master/src/VolatilityEstimatorMovingWindow_Analysis.java">VolatilityEstimatorMovingWindow_Analysis.java</a></strong> - this class is designed to perform the volatility analysis of high-frequency data computed in two ways: using the squared return function which calculates the aggregated standart deviation of the time series over time intervals of the fixed length and using the method based on the directional-change intrinsic time approach of interpreting evolution of high-frequency prices.</li>
